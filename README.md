# SiegeWar
*SiegeWar* adds a war system to *Towny*.
### Features
* ‚öîÔ∏è **Sieges:** Wars are conducted by means of sieges. A siege occurs when a nation attacks a town.
* üåç **Inclusive:** The whole server is involved, with no opt-outs. So a nation can conquer the world!. 
* ü§ñ **Automatic:** Sieges are started by players and automatically managed by the plugin. Daily staff management of sieges is not required.
* üö∂ **Slow Paced:** Each siege consists of 7 hours fighting time, spread over the course of a weekend.
* üèôÔ∏è **Non-Destructive:** Towns cannot be damaged or stolen from during sieges. Towns can get extra protection by activating the *Peaceful* option, which makes them immune to sieges, but vulnerable to instant-capture.

### Credits:
- *SiegeWar* was initially developed by [Goosius1](https://github.com/Goosius1), starting in the summer of 2019.
- Originally *SiegeWar* was a fork of *Towny*, being built directly into *Towny*. 
- *SiegeWar* was later transformed by [LlmDl](https://github.com/LlmDl) & [Warriorrr](https://github.com/Warriorrrr) into the plugin which exists today. This work took about 2 months, and involved adding many many API events to *Towny*, and changing the entire *SiegeWar* database to use *Towny* metadata. The plugin was released in January 2021.
- Following the release of the plugin, many new features and improvements were added, with key contributions from [Goosius1](https://github.com/Goosius1), [LlmDl](https://github.com/LlmDl), and [Warriorrr](https://github.com/Warriorrrr). Multiple other developers have contributed also, notably [Ceeedric](https://github.com/ceeedric).
- Special thanks to the servers *CCNET*, *DatBlock*, and *EarthPol*, who pioneered the use of the system, and have provided much valuable information, feedback, and bug reports.
- [Goosius1](https://github.com/Goosius1) was the maintainer of this repo for the TownyAdvanced org, until his retirement from *Minecraft* plugin development in October 2021.
- *SiegeWar* is now maintained by the TownyAdvanced org.
