# SiegeWar
*SiegeWar* adds a war system to *Towny*.
### Features
* ⚔️ **Sieges**: Wars are conducted by means of sieges. A siege occurs when a nation attacks a town.
* 🤖 **Automatic:** Sieges are started by players and automatically managed by the plugin. Daily staff management of war is not required.
* 🏙️ **Minimally Destructive:** During sieges, towns cannot be damaged or stolen from.
* 🚶 **Slow Paced:** Sieges last 3 days, giving defenders a chance to respond to attacks, and also making the system friendly to casual players.
* 🗺️ **Geopolitical:** The whole server is involved, with no opt-outs. Nations and towns always have a *Peaceful* option, where they can become immune to attack, but vulnerable to peaceful occupation.
* ♟️ **Strategic:** The system has many strategic elements (*e.g. deciding when/where/who to attack, organizing army composition/logisitics/movement, and  diplomacy/occupation/peacefulness etc*). This can be great for thoughful/mature playerbases, but for servers which require more simplistic PVP contests, alternative war systems should be considered.
* 🍎 **Non-Toxic:** If you install the recommended [*TownyResources*](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/TownyResources) plugin, wars become more focused on the strategic acquisition of material resources, instead of the toxic settlement of personal grudges.

### Credits:
- *SiegeWar* was initially developed by [Goosius1](https://github.com/Goosius1), starting in the summer of 2019.
- Originally *SiegeWar* was a fork of *Towny*, being built directly into *Towny*. 
- *SiegeWar* was later transformed by [LlmDl](https://github.com/LlmDl) & [Warriorrr](https://github.com/Warriorrrr) into the plugin which exists today. This work took about 2 months, and involved adding many many API events to *Towny*, and changing the entire *SiegeWar* database to use *Towny* metadata. The plugin was released in January 2021.
- Following the release of the plugin, many new features and improvements were added, with key contributions from [Goosius1](https://github.com/Goosius1), [LlmDl](https://github.com/LlmDl), and [Warriorrr](https://github.com/Warriorrrr). Multiple other developers have contributed also, notably [Ceeedric](https://github.com/ceeedric).
- Contributions from other developers continue to be welcome.
- Special thanks to the servers *CCNET*, *DatBlock*, and *Nebula*, who pioneered the use of the system, and have provided much valuable information, feedback, and bug reports.
- [Goosius1](https://github.com/Goosius1) is the maintainer of this repo for the TownyAdvanced org, and will be coding to his own schedule.
